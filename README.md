This repository contains Â Restaurant Management System written in C, with an emphasis on concurrent programming for efficient simulation of various restaurant activities. The system runs numerous concurrent processes, including Waiter, Chef, Customer, and Manager, and uses inter-process communication mechanisms such as shared memory and message passing to ensure flawless interaction and synchronization. The solution, based on Operating System concepts, provides process creation, synchronization primitives, and resource management to ensure reliable simulation of complicated restaurant settings. Wait() and sleep() are used for efficient process synchronization, reflecting real-world restaurant dynamics where time and coordination are crucial. This project provides a complete framework for analyzing and optimizing restaurant management using concurrent programming paradigms.
